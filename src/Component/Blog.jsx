        <p className="blog-content">
         Hi! I'm <strong  className="tilleRed">Nivetha Mathivanan</strong> ‚Äî I started my journey with a B.Sc. in Botany, never knowing that one day I would be writing lines of code instead of studying plant cells.
          Due to some family and financial situations, I couldn't continue my higher studies. But somehow, I got curious about the computer field ‚Äî especially things like design and editing. That interest slowly pulled me into the world of Front-End Development.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="tilleRed"> How It Started</strong>
          ‚û• Heard about HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap ,JavaScript ‚Äî started learning on my own. No fancy setup or classes. Just free tutorials and a ton of Googling.
          ‚û• I had no idea what I was doing with ReactJS. I tried, failed, cried, and coded again. React felt like a wall I couldn‚Äôt climb ‚Äî but day by day, night after night‚Ä¶ I kept trying.
        </p>
        <p><strong className="tilleRed">Experiments I Did (That Changed Everything)</strong>
        ‚û• useState for managing form state
        ‚û•for-loops like: for let i = 0 ; i++
        ‚û• Billing App logic: Button styles, Table layout, GST, discount, total
        ‚û•Every component, every function ‚Äî a small win that made me confident.
        </p>
        <p><strong className="tilleRed"> UI Design Decisions (That Felt Special)</strong>
        ‚û• Designing is not just code ‚Äî I feel it. A button might change 15 times until it's perfect.
          I explore 5‚Äì6 websites just for layout inspiration. Animations via framer-motion add life. Alignments matter. Style + Logic = Magic.
        </p>
        <p><strong className="tilleRed">My Coding Journey</strong>
        ‚û•  Some paid courses. Just willpower. Science background ‚Üí Self-taught developer.
          I didn‚Äôt quit when it was hard. I paused, learned, and continued. Today, I say proudly: I am a React Developer.
        </p>
        <p><strong className="tilleRed"> My Learning System</strong>

        ‚û• Online classes
        ‚û• Handwritten notes
        ‚û• Google for every doubt
        ‚û• Use ChatGPT & AI tools for ideas, debugging, and guidance
        ‚û• ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs confusing ‚Äî Google it, ask ChatGPT, read again".

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="tilleRed">  Mini Challenges I Solved</strong>

          ‚û• Form validations using useState
          ‚û• React useEffect loops and alternate hook handling
          ‚û• Billing page with dynamic product table, GST & discount calculation
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="tilleRed"> Tips from Me to You</strong>

          ‚û• Don‚Äôt fear hard topics ‚Äì break them down
          ‚û• Repeat code until your hands memorize it
          ‚û• Design is not just visual ‚Äî it reflects your logic
          ‚û• Any background can switch to coding with consistency + curiosity
        </p>

          "I studied Botany. But today, I design, I code, and I‚Äôm building the life of a developer.
          It‚Äôs not about what you studied ‚Äî it‚Äôs about what you choose to become.
